### üîç Overview

**Book Store API** is a stateless backend application designed to power a modern online bookstore. It enables customers to browse books, place orders, and manage returns. It supports both **authenticated users** and **guests**, allowing guests to place orders without registration.

The API also includes secure **admin-level endpoints**, enabling administrators to manage the book catalog, validate orders, and process return requests. Built with **Spring Boot 3** and **Spring Security 6**, it uses **JWT-based authentication** and follows REST best practices to ensure maintainability, scalability, and clarity.

### ‚úÖ Key Features

  - Guests can place orders without creating an account.

- **Book Catalog Management** (Admin Only)
  - Admins can add, update, delete, and publish books.
  - Full control over book visibility and metadata.

- **Order Management**
  - Customers can place and (if authenticated) track their orders.
  - Orders can be updated or canceled based on business rules.
  - Admins can validate and process orders.

- **Return Workflow**
  - Customers may request to return purchased books.
  - Admins approve or reject return requests.

- **Role-Based Access Control**
  - Roles: `ADMIN`, `CUSTOMER`, `MEMBER`, `GUEST`.
